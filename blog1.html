                <h2>iPhone SE 4 Release: What We Can Expect</h2>
                <p>
                    Apple is set to unveil the <strong>iPhone SE 4</strong> on <strong>February 19, 2025</strong>, marking a significant update to its budget-friendly iPhone lineup. 
                    This model is expected to feature a <strong>6.1-inch OLED Super Retina XDR display</strong>, aligning with the design of the iPhone 14. 
                    The device will also introduce <strong>Face ID</strong>, replacing the traditional Home button, and include a <strong>USB-C</strong> port for charging and data transfer.

                <p>
                    Under the hood, the iPhone SE 4 is anticipated to be powered by Apple's <strong>A18 chip</strong>, the same processor expected in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, coupled with <strong>8 GB of RAM</strong>. 
                    The camera system will feature a <strong>48MP rear sensor</strong> and a <strong>24MP front-facing camera</strong>, enhancing the overall photography experience.
                    These upgrades will make the iPhone SE 4 a strong contender in the mid-range smartphone market, delivering improved performance and better camera capabilities.

                    Pricing is expected to start below <strong>$700</strong>, maintaining the iPhone SE's reputation for offering high-end features at a more affordable price point. 
                    This strategic pricing aligns with Apple's approach to cater to a broader audience without compromising on quality and innovation.
