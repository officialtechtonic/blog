    <h2>Design: Premium and Sleek</h2>
    <p>Samsung continues to impress with the design of the Galaxy S25 series. The new models feature a glass and metal body with a stunning finish that shines under the light. The S25 and S25+ come with smooth, curved edges, while the S25 Ultra sports a more squared-off design, offering a more premium feel for those who prefer a larger display and sturdier frame.</p>
    <p>The series is also <strong>IP68 water-resistant</strong>, meaning you don’t have to worry about dust or splashes near water. With a thinner profile and lightweight design, it fits comfortably in the hand, although the Ultra model might be a bit large for some.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Color Options:</strong> The Galaxy S25 series is available in a variety of colors, including sleek Phantom Black, Glacier Blue, and new exclusive hues like Forest Green and Sunset Orange for those who want a unique touch.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Display: Vivid and Immersive</h2>
    <p>One of the standout features of the Galaxy S25 series is the display. The S25 and S25+ come with stunning Dynamic AMOLED 2X panels that support vibrant colors and deep blacks. The 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling, gaming, and watching videos an absolute treat.</p>
    <p>However, it's the S25 Ultra's 6.8-inch display that truly steals the show. With a 3200 x 1440 resolution, this display is absolutely crisp, perfect for anyone who loves high-definition content. HDR10+ support enhances your viewing experience with improved contrast and color accuracy, whether you're watching a movie, playing a game, or editing photos.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Performance: Blazing Speed</h2>
    <p>The Galaxy S25 series is powered by the latest <strong>Exynos 2500</strong> (or Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, depending on your region), coupled with up to 16GB of RAM. This hardware combination allows the phones to handle even the most demanding apps with ease. Whether you’re gaming, multitasking, or running resource-heavy applications, the S25 series performs without any noticeable lag or slowdown.</p>
    <p>In addition, the series supports <strong>5G connectivity</strong>, meaning faster internet speeds whether you’re downloading large files or streaming high-quality content.</p>

The S25 Ultra also boasts advanced AI enhancements that help with portrait mode, night shots, and video stabilization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The camera’s video capabilities are equally impressive, capable of recording in <strong>8K resolution at 30fps</strong> for incredibly detailed footage. With AI-driven features like video portrait mode, real-time zoom, and more, the S25 series brings professional-grade features to your pocket.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Battery Life: All-Day Power</h2>

The S25 packs a 4,500mAh battery, the S25+ comes with a 4,800mAh battery, and the S25 Ultra is powered by a 5,000mAh cell. Coupled with Samsung’s efficient processing chip and software optimizations, you can expect up to <strong>15-18 hours of use</strong> depending on your usage habits.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Software and Features: One UI 6.0 and More</h2>
