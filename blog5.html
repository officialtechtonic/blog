            <h1>Can Musk damage OpenAI even though his bid has failed?</h1><br>

      <br>
        <p>OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.</p>
                  <br>
        <p>But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.</p> <br>
        <p>That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.</p>
        <br>          
        <p>Musk is "basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory," said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=81s" >interview</a> with the BBC.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Profit & non-profit</h3>
        <p>Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (Â£78.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.</p>
                  <br>
        <p>It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.</p>
                  <br>
        <p>Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.</p>
                  <br>
        <p>Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.</p>
                  <br>
        <p>That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.</p>
                 
        <p>"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit," said Dr Penn.</p>
        <p>The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.</p>
                 
        <p>"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do," Mr Finger told the BBC. "It's very simple."
