        <h2>Telecom Price Hikes Spark Outrage Amid Nigeria's Economic Struggles</h2>
        <p>Nigerians are expressing outrage over a significant jump in the price of mobile data charged by some of the country's major phone networks.</p>
        <p>MTN, Nigeria's largest operator, has trebled the cost of one of its most popular weekly offers. Airtel has also increased its tariffs.</p>
        <p>A price hike was expected as the telecoms regulatory body had approved an increase. However, in an announcement three weeks ago, it had capped the increase at 50%. The phone companies argued that the price increase was necessary to boost their revenue in order to cover rising operational costs.</p>
        <p>Many Nigerians are struggling with a long-standing cost-of-living crisis, with inflation rates not seen for three decades. Any increase in prices adds to the already heavy burden many Nigerians face in trying to make ends meet.</p>
        <p>In response to customer complaints, MTN issued a statement on <strong>X</strong>, saying the price adjustment was necessary to "serve subscribers better." The company apologized for any inconvenience caused, adding: "We apologize for any inconvenience caused." Airtel has yet to comment.</p>
        <p>Subscribers only realized the price hikes when attempting to purchase data in the past few hours. The BBC has contacted Airtel for more information on the changes.</p>
        <p>Many social media comments have criticized the increase, with some stating that the price hikes could cut off a significant number of people, especially at a time when the economy is already in turmoil.</p>
        <p>One of the main targets for criticism is the increase in MTN's 15GB weekly bundle, which jumped from 2,000 naira ($1.33; Â£1.08) to 6,000 naira ($3.99). A user on X commented: "What sort of outrageous increase is that?... Just making sure the masses suffer more." Another wrote: "Triple the amount? The end time is near."</p>
        <p>Subscribers are also complaining that MTN's 1GB bundle has more than doubled in price, and Airtel has trebled the cost of a similar offer.</p>
        <p>People who use Globacom, the third-largest network, say they have not been affected by increases.</p>
        <p>The Nigeria Communications Commission, which regulates the telecom companies, is yet to react to the price rises, which in some cases appear to exceed the cap that it had recommended.</p>
        <p>Digital content creator Mubarak Uniquepikin told the BBC that the tariff hike could have a major impact on businesses that depend on being online. "The economy is already comatose, and for this to come in now when a lot of people can't rent shops and have taken their business online is bad," he said. "Many young people already find it difficult to buy data, and this would definitely make it worse for them."</p>
        <p>Nigeria is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation. A rise in inflation caused by the war in Ukraine was exacerbated when, in 2023, President Bola Tinubu's government dropped the fuel subsidy. The authorities also followed a policy of currency devaluation. Both measures were intended to restore long-term stability, but in the meantime, many people have suffered.</p>
